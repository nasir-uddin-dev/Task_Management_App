Themes are an integral part of UI for any application. Themes are used
to design the fonts and colors of an application to make it more presentable.
In Flutter, The Theme widget is used to add themes to an application. One can
use it either for a particular part of the application like buttons and navigation
bar or define it in the root of the application to use it throughout the entire
app.
